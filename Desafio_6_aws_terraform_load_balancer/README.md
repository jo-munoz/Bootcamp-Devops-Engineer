# Configuraci√≥n de Ejemplo: AWS, Terraform y Balanceador de Carga

## Comandos:

* Inicializar el directorio de trabajo de terraform:

````bash
terraform init
````

* Verificar que recursos se crearan con el siguiente comando:

````bash
terraform plan
````

* Si todo es correcto se crea la maquina virtual con el comando:

````bash
terraform apply
````

## Terraform plan output

```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
